# Sorting Algorithm Comparison

This repository provides implementations and performance analysis for 9 popular sorting algorithms. The included algorithms are:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Bucket Sort
3. Counting Sort
4. Heap Sort
5. Insertion Sort
6. Merge Sort
7. Quick Sort
8. Radix Sort
9. Selection Sort

## Overview

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in Python for easy understanding of beginenrs. The repository aims to help developers understand the strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms, aided by the help of graphs.

## Contents

- `sorts/`: Source code for each sorting algorithm in different programming languages.
- `comparison-report`: Performance analysis and comparisons.
- `README`: Brief intro to the repo.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Me-AU/DAA-compare-sorting-algos
   ```

2. Explore the `sorts/` directory for implementations.

3. Check the `comparison-report/` directory for performance comparisons.

Feel free to contribute by adding more languages, more sorts, improving existing implementations, or providing additional insights into algorithmic performance.
